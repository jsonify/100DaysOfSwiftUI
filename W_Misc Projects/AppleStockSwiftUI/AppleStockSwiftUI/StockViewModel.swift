 View Models are responsible for providing data to the view. The StockViewModel exposes several properties that represent a stock. These properties include symbol, description, price, and change. You can also see that price and symbol have custom formatting because they have to be displayed on the interface in a particular way. The view models give us the flexibility to customize data before its displayed on the view.
